# Hi. Hello. Thanks for stopping by...why don't you pull up a chair and stay awhile.


You have entered the land of Shauna 🌍 (she/her). I am a software engineer, studying at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/). I graduate **early October of 2021**. Let's grab a ☕️ and chat. I would love to learn more about the software world, what you do, and what your company culture is like.

When I'm not completely consumed in a coding frenzy, I spend my time singing, playing the violin and guitar; reading literature from the 19th century, hiking, and traveling. Fun fact about me: I've completed the last 3 months of my remote program, at Turing, from the beautiful country of Scotland. So, I have become a professional at balancing communication and work with team members whilst in drastically different time zones.


- 💬 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shauna-myers/)
- 👩🏻‍🏫 Education History: Psychology, art school, business administration, and architecture/drafting/design.
- 🏋🏻‍♀️ Work History: Most of my employment history has been in the casino industry, as a supervisor and a table games dealer. This allows me to work in a fast paced and ever changing environment. It has equipped me with top tier interpersonal skills and with an incredible ability to mediate and resolve conflicts.

</p>

This was the first project in module 3, just over the halfway point in my software engineering program at Turing. This was built using React, React Router, APIs, and was tested with Cypress. It was completed in just over a week and a half. I enjoyed diving into React and learning how to more effectively keep the DOM up to date with changing state in components.
