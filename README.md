# Hi. Hello. Thanks for stopping by...why don't you pull up a chair and stay awhile.


I'm Shauna (she/her). 

<br>

I am a software engineer. I studied at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) and graduated at the **end of September 2021**. 

<br>

Let's grab a ‚òïÔ∏è (virtual or in real life) and talk tech.

<br>

When I'm not completely consumed in a coding frenzy, I spend my time painting, singing, playing the violin and guitar; reading literature from the 19th century, hiking, and traveling. Sustainability is a passion of mine, especially sustainable construction. In 2015 I completed an academy through [Earthship Biotecture](https://www.earthshipglobal.com/), in Taos, NM., where I learned how to build completely self-sustainable houses out of recycled materials.

<br>

Fun fact about me: I completed the last 3 months of my remote software engineering program from the beautiful country of Scotland. So, I have become a professional at balancing communication and work with team members whilst in drastically different time zones.

<br>

- üí° I am proficient in JavaScript, React, and Ruby on Rails, and Ruby on Sinatra. I am learning Next.js in my free time.
- üí¨ [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shauna-myers/)
- üë©üèª‚Äçüè´ Education History: Psychology, art school, business administration, and architecture/drafting/design.
- üèãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Work History: I have worked at [Checkr, Inc.]([url](https://checkr.com/)) for almost 3 years as a full-stack software engineer. Before that I worked in the casino industry, as a supervisor and a table games dealer. This was a dynamic and fast paced environment. No day was ever like the last and I was continuously challenging myself to learn new skills. This industry also equipped me with excellent interpersonal and conflict resolution skills.

## My Recent Projects üï∏

### BarnRaiser

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/Barn-Raiser/barn-raiser-ui"><img width="300" align='right' src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74690897/133356567-38d4f415-106a-4e00-bda2-230c5f990d04.gif"></a>
</p>

Completed in 2 1/2 weeks in a team of four. Allows users a platform to ask for assistance with a particular need or to view a list of needs and volunteer for one or many. This was my first time working directly with a backend team. This was a great experience. Not only did I get to immerse myself in their terminology (MVC, pagination, schema) but our frontend team was able to communicate about what the data needed to look like. Planning and discussing our process was vital throughout this project. We focused on an agile workflow and broke up our goals into phases and easy to manage sprints. Communication and thorough planning is absolutely key to a fluid group project!

#### technologies: *Frontend* React, React Router, JavaScript, ApolloClient, Cypress, Heroku  |  *Backend* GraphQL, PostGreSQL, Ruby on Rails, Heroku

### Turing Tip Jar

</p>

Built in one week. Provides Turing Alum and students the ability to add tips for other Turing members to search through and rate. This was a huge learning curve, as I had never dabbled in the backend before. It gave me some experience in the world of databases and servers and I cannot wait to learn more! 

#### technologies: React, React Router, JavaScript, ApolloClient, Cypress, Express, PostGreSQL, Heroku

</p>

This was the first project in module 3, just over the halfway point in my software engineering program at Turing. This was built using React, React Router, APIs, and was tested with Cypress. It was completed in just over a week and a half. I enjoyed diving into React and learning how to more effectively keep the DOM up to date with changing state in components. 

#### technologies: React, React Router, JavaScript, Cypress, deployed to Vercel
